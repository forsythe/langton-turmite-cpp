### Summary

I remade my [processing version of langton's turmite](https://github.com/forsythe/langtons-turmite) in C++ with SDL. This version only lets you spawn one ant at a time in the center of the screen. However, it is much faster than the processing version.

### How it works  
The program will ask you for a movement pattern when you first run it. See explanation given in the processing version above.
